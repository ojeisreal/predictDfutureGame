Prediction challenge Game; self development project
A game where you are to select five tiles, out of which three must be the same number
A single random number between 1-9 and 3 random tile locations is genreated, to store the single random number. this is to ensure at at any point the game is placyed three tiles must have thesame number, as testing (100 iterations), shows that there is only a 51% chance that random numbers generated for all tiles wil yeild three or more tiles with same numbers.
random numbers between 1-9 are generated randomly for the remaining six tiles
upon successful or failed selection by the user, the user is prompted to play again or if interested: reveal all the numbers hidden under the tiles
player name, attempts and succesful predictions are stored in local storage
user can also give feedback to me, via mail
